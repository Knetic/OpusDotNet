# OpusDotNet

non finished version of a opus implementation in unity. it does a local compression and decompression of audio taken from a microphone. it's missing networking.

based on opusdotnetinvoke, added an example how to use it within unity and compiled the libraries on windows and osx.

hopefully someone can use this and make his improvements available to the public as well!

tested on:
windows 10, 64bit
osx 10.11.5
